A platform for analysing blood drying patterns, originating from the brilliant [frugal science community](https://www.frugalscience.org/).

We are still exploring different methods to discriminate different conditions. Right now, the focus lies on reproducing the results presented in [Machine Learning Analysis for Quantitative Discrimination of Dried Blood Droplets](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59847-x).

## Setup

This repo uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as package manager. If you have it installed simply run `poetry install` to download and install the dependencies and `poetry run jupyter notebook` to run the notebooks. 

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies as defined in the _pyproject.toml_ with the package manager of your choice.
